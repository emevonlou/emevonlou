# Hi 👋

I work at the intersection of **Security Operations** and **Detection Engineering**, where detection logic meets real(world noise).

Blue Team by role  
Detection engineering by function  
SIEM by environment  
Network security & forensics by context  

What my work usually involves:
- designing, testing, and tuning detection logic  
- correlating events across hosts, networks, and identities  
- investigating alerts through timelines and evidence  
- reducing noise without losing visibility  

How I think about detection:
- behavior over signatures  
- hypotheses before alerts  
- context before severity  
- repeatability before cleverness  

I focus on **behavioral detections** aligned with adversary techniques, built from available telemetry and validated through investigation(not assumptions).

Most of my projects reflect **SOC-ready detection workflows**: logic that explains itself, survives tuning cycles, and still makes sense months later.

If you’re looking for detections that support analysts instead of overwhelming them, you’re probably in the right place.
