## About Me

I approach technology as systems, not tools.
Focused on backend fundamentals, security-aware design, and understanding how things fail outside the happy path.

Code should be predictable under pressure, defend its assumptions, and justify its complexity.
Security isn’t paranoia,it’s method.

Blue team mindset.
Cat-assisted zero-trust enforcement included.
